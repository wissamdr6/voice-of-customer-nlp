## 🚀 Overview

This project provides a complete pipeline for **Voice-of-Customer (VoC) analytics**, including:
- automatic sentiment detection
- aspect extraction (ABSA)
- sentiment per aspect
- topic discovery for negative feedback
- clustering of user complaints
- monitoring over time
- production inference service (FastAPI + Docker)

The goal is to transform unstructured feedback into **actionable product insights**.
